Steps necessaries to get the application up:

* rvm install ruby-2.3.4

* bundle install

* rake test

This branch is on development. Tests have been written but it's not passing.
Create a model and change the controller to respect the restaurant inventory.

Keep it simple. Do not over-engineer your solution!
We are more interested on the architecture and tests passing.

When you finished create a pull request.
We'll analise together in an hangout meeting.

Good luck dude!
